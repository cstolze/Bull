Names are composed of any alphanumeric symbol, _ and '.
Terms and types have the same syntax.

Comments are enclosed between (* and *), Ã  la Coq.

Syntax of terms:
----------------
```
| Type					   # sort Type
| let ID [args] [: term] := term in term   # let construct
| name					   # identifier
| forall x : term, term			   # dependent product
| term -> term	   			   # non-dependent product
| fun x : term => type			   # lambda-abstraction
| sforall x : term, term		   # relevant dependent product
| term >> term	    			   # relevant non-dependent product
| sfun x : term => term			   # relevant lambda-abstraction
| term term    	  			   # application
| term & term				   # intersection of types
| term | term				   # union of types
| <term, term>				   # strong pair
| proj_l term			  	   # left projection of a strong pair
| proj_r term			           # right projection of a strong pair
| smatch term [as id] [return term] with
  id [:t] => term, id [:t] => term	   # strong co-pair
| inj_l term term   	  		   # left injection
| inj_r term term			   # right injection
```

- Relevant lambda-abstractions only type terms equivalent to the identity function.
- Strong pair has an intersection type and both its arguments must share the same essence.
- the strong co-pair syntax is similar to the Coq `match` operator.
- The first argument of the injection is the type that is added in a union to the type of the
  second argument.
